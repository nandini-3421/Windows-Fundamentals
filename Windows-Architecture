# Windows Architecture

Windows OS is designed using a layered architecture to improve stability and security.

## User Mode
- Runs user applications and services
- Has limited access to system resources
- Cannot directly access hardware
- Examples:
  - Web browsers
  - Office applications
  - Media players

If a user-mode application crashes, the operating system continues running.

## Kernel Mode
- Has unrestricted access to system hardware
- Responsible for critical system operations
- Components include:
  - Windows Kernel
  - Device Drivers
  - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

If a kernel-mode component fails, it can cause a system crash (BSOD).

## Why this separation matters
- Improves system stability
- Prevents malicious applications from damaging the OS
- Enforces security boundaries
