# Users and Groups in Windows

Windows uses users and groups to manage access and permissions.

## User Accounts
- Administrator: Full system access
- Standard User: Limited privileges
- Guest: Temporary and restricted access

## Groups
Groups simplify permission management.

Common groups include:
- Administrators
- Users
- Backup Operators
- Remote Desktop Users

## Best Practices
- Assign permissions to groups instead of users
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Avoid using Administrator account for daily work
